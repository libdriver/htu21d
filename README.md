## LibDriver HTU21D

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/htu21d/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The HTU21D(F) is a new digital humidity sensor with temperature output by MEAS. Setting new standards in terms of size and intelligence, it is embedded in a reflow solderable Dual Flat No leads (DFN) package with a small 3 x 3 x 0.9 mm footprint. This sensor provides calibrated, linearized signals in digital, I²C format. HTU21D(F) digital humidity sensors are dedicated humidity and temperature plug and play transducers for OEM applications where reliable and accurate measurements are needed. Direct interface with a micro-controller is made possible with the module for humidity and temperature digital outputs. These low power sensors are designed for high volume and cost sensitive applications with tight space constraints.Every sensor is individually calibrated and tested. Lot identification is printed on the sensor and an electronic identification code is stored on the chip – which can be read out by command. Low battery can be detected and a checksum improves communication reliability. The resolution of these digital humidity sensors can be changed by command (8/12bit up to 12/14bit for RH/T).It is used in Home appliance, medical, printers, humidifier and so on .

LibDriver HTU21D is a full-featured driver of HTU21D launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading temperature and relative humidity. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/interface includes LibDriver HTU21D IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver HTU21D driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver HTU21D sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver HTU21D offline document.

/datasheet includes HTU21D datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_htu21d_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temperature;
uint8_t humidity;

res = htu21d_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    htu21d_interface_delay_ms(2000);
    res = htu21d_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (uint8_t *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)htu21d_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    htu21d_interface_debug_print("htu21d: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    htu21d_interface_debug_print("htu21d: humidity is %d%%.\n", humidity); 
    
    ...
        
}

...

(void)htu21d_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
